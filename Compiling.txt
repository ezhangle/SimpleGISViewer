How to compile the project
==========================


   These are generic compilation instructions.

The solution compiles with Microsoft Visual Studio 2012, and also with the VS2005.
If use VS2012 express, you need to install VS2012 update1 and Windows SDK. 
We turn off C++ exception handler (/EHsc, we don't need it ;-) ) to produce faster and small code.
